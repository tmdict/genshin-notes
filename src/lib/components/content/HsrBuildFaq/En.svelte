<h5>About</h5>

<p>
  All build recommendations and reference data are compiled from <a href="https://bbs.nga.cn/read.php?tid=36580156">NGA: 崩铁|全角色参考面板</a>, and supplemented with information from <a href="https://www.prydwen.gg/star-rail/characters/">Prydwen</a>.

<h5>Reference Stats</h5>

<p>
  Recommended stats are rounded using the following criteria:
</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Rounded to nearest 1: Speed, Effect Hit Rate, Heal</li>
    <li>Rounded to nearest 5: Crit Rate%, Crit Dmg%, Effect Res%, Energy Recharge%, Break Effect</li>
    <li>Rounded to nearest 100: HP, Attack, Defense</li>
  </ul>

<p>
  Recommended stats are ordered by their priority. Stats below a solid line are other common substats in non-prioritzed list.
</p>
  
<p>
  Sometimes a range ("<code>-</code>")is given if there is a huge difference due to recommended light cones or relic primary stats. If different builds are recommended (different primary stats or relic/ornament), a difference in stat is separated by a slash ("<code>/</code>").
