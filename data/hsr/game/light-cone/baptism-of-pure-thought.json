For every debuff on the enemy target, the wearer's CRIT DMG dealt against this target additionally increases by {{8//9//10//11//12%}}, stacking up to 3 times. When using Ultimate to attack the enemy target, the wearer receives the Disputation effect, which increases DMG dealt by {{36//42//48//54//60%}} and enables their follow-up attacks to ignore {{24//28//32//36//40%}} of the target's DEF. This effect lasts for 2 turns."
