Stacks can still be triggered when the equipping character is not on the field. Each stack’s duration is counted independently. In addition, when 3 stacks are active, Elemental Burst CRIT Rate will be increased by {{28//35//42//49//56}}. This effect will be canceled 4s after falling under 3 stacks."
