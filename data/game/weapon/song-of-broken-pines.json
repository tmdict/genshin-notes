Increases ATK by {{16//20//24//28//32%}}, and when Normal or Charged Attacks hit opponents, the character gains a Sigil of Whispers. This effect can be triggered once every 0.3s. When you possess 4 Sigils of Whispers, all of them will be consumed and all nearby party members will obtain the “Millennial Movement: Banner-Hymn” effect for 12s. “Millennial Movement: Banner-Hymn” increases Normal ATK SPD by {{12//15//18//21//24%}} and increases ATK by {{20//25//30//35//40%}}. Once this effect is triggered, you will not gain Sigils of Whispers for 20s. Of the many effects of the “Millennial Movement,” buffs of the same type will not stack."
