  description: "In “Good Sign,” help Zhihua find 5 signs that romance is coming his way."
  notes: |
    There are 5 signs but each commission will only give you two at random. Four have two possible outcomes, so at minimum you need to do this commission 5 times to unlock both achievements.

    Finding all 5 “signs of an imminent romance” grants the achievement “Love is All Around”:
    1. Seeing that Granny Shan has good business
    2. Leaving the pigeons alone
    3. Leaving the dogs alone
    4. Leaving the cat and fish alone
    5. Leaving the leaves alone

    (Ruining 4 “signs of an imminent romance” grants the hidden achievement “Open to Interpretation”)
