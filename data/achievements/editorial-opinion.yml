  commission:
  - "Is This Novel Amazing?"
  - "This Novel Seems… Problematic?"
  - "This Novel… Seems Familiar?"
  notes: | 
    During “Is This Novel Amazing?”, siding with Junkichi will unlock the chance to receive “This Novel Seems… Problematic?” while siding with Shigeru will unlock a chance to receive “This Novel… Seems Familiar?”, completing both commissions grants the achievement.

    Submitting the book “Literature Club” first unlocks the “Storytelling Method” World Quest, which grants the “Well, At Least It Ended” achievement.

  - "这本小说…好像看过？"
  notes: | 
    在「这本小说…厉害吗？」里支持顺吉后就能够在日后刷出委托「这本小说…有问题？」，支持阿茂的话就有机会刷出和「这本小说…好像看过？」，把两个委托都完成即可。（在「这本小说…好像看过？」里，根据指引找到3本书，只交付《文学团》即可）。

    之后可以解锁「故事构思法」，完成后获得成就「至少有了个结局」。
