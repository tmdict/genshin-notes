  commission:
  - "Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering"
  notes: | 
    After getting the initial commission “Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering,” you will receive this achievement if the follow-up commission is the one where Hatim goes bargain-hunting.
    
    Getting the “Fortune” version will lead to the “Kalimi’s Fungus” achievement. Other follow-ups yield no achievements.

    (This has not bene proven, and the commission is for the most part, random) Follow-up commission may be related to quality of food used, a "delicious" version may increase your chance of getting “fortune” follow-ups, while a “suspcious” version increases the chance of getting “loss” follow-ups. The food chosen does not affect the follow-up.

  commission:
  - "吞金和蓄财"
  notes: | 
    首先接到每日任务「吞金和蓄财」，三种吞金料理任选其一提交后可能出现三种后续，若为大亏，则获得成就。

    若后续为大赚，可以获得成就「卡里米之蕈兽」。其它后续无成就。

    后续与交付料理品质有关，给美味的料理赚钱的可能性越大，给奇怪的料理赔钱的可能性更大。三种食物于后续无关。
