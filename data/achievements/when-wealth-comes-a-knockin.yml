  commission:
  - "Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering"
  notes: | 
    After getting the initial commission “Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering”, you will receive this achievement if the follow-up commission is the one where Hatim goes bargain-hunting.
    
    Getting the “Fortune” version will lead to the “Kalimi’s Fungus” achievement. Other follow-ups yield no achievements.

    Follow-up commission seems to be completely random and not affected by the type and quality of food used.

  commission:
  - "吞金和蓄财"
  notes: | 
    首先接到每日任务「吞金和蓄财」，三种吞金料理任选其一提交后可能出现三种后续，若为大亏，则获得成就。

    若后续为大赚，可以获得成就「卡里米之蕈兽」。其它后续无成就。

    后续的概率完全随机，与交付料理种类和品质没有关系。
