  commission:
  - "Problem Conversion"
  - "Problem Conversion: Theory Reliability"
  - "Problem Conversion: Loading Capacity"
  notes: | 
    If only three planks were collected during the commission “Problem Conversion: Theory Reliability”, the player receives the Ship Failure version (“Problem Conversion: The Underpinning Factor”) of the commission. If five planks were collected, the player receives the Ship Success version instead. Completing the Ship Success version of the commission grants the achievement.

  - "问题的转化"
  - "问题的转化·理论强度"
  - "问题的转化·负载问题"
  notes: | 
    在做「阶段二·理论强度」分支时总共有五块木板，拿三块的时候派蒙会说：已经有三块了，这样应该就足够了。此时如果拿满五块木板，之后完成「阶段三·负载问题」获得成就。
