  commission:
  - "Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering"
  notes: | 
    After getting the initial commission “Gold Devouring and Mora Gathering,” you will receive this achievement if the follow-up commission is the one where Hatim makes a fortune.
    
    Getting the “Bargain-Hunting” version will lead to the “When Wealth Comes A-Knockin’” achievement. Other follow-ups yield no achievements.

    Follow-up commission may be related to quality of food used, a "delicious" version may increase your chance of getting “fortune” follow-ups, while a “suspcious” version increases the chance of getting “loss” follow-ups. The food chosen does not affect the follow-up.

  commission:
  - "吞金和蓄财"
  notes: | 
    首先接到每日任务「吞金和蓄财」，三种吞金料理任选其一提交后可能出现三种后续，若为大赚，则获得成就。

    若后续为大亏，给他一份苹果酿后获得成就「当财运来敲门」。其它后续无成就。

    后续与交付料理品质有关，给美味的料理赚钱的可能性越大，给奇怪的料理赔钱的可能性更大。三种食物于后续无关。

    todo2: "究极亏本状态"
