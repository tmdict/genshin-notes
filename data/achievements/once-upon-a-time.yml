    All three NPCs will appear during the commission (prior to version 3.5 only two random NPCs would appear). Each will give you a different story excerpt.

    After giving one excerpt to Liu Su, the other excerpt will remain in your inventory and can be used during future commissions.

  - "且听下回分解"
  notes: |
    刘苏会要求玩家去询问其他NPC，一共有3位（3.5版本前只有两位随机NPC会出现），让玩家和三位NPC对话。交付任务道具后剩下的一本书可以留到下一次任务用。

    交付《裁雨声·上》与《裁雨声·中》的话可以获得成就「"旅者且留步…」。
