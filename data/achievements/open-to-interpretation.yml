    There are 5 signs but each commission will only give you two at random. Four have two possible outcomes, so at minimum you need to do this commission 5 times to unlock both achievements.

    Ruining 4 “signs of an imminent romance” grants the hidden achievement “Open to Interpretation”:
    1. Killing the pigeons
    2. Scaring the dogs away
    3. Harvesting or killing the fish or the cat
    4. Burning or blowing away the leaves
